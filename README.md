# Springboard-Course-Linear-Regression

The Objective of this project is to apply linear regression algorithm. to slove the problem of house price prediction. 
The packages we'll cover are: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Part 1: Mathmetics behind linear regression
Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis for Linear Relationships
       -- Descpritive Analysis
       -- Data visualization
Part 3: Using Statsmodels to investigate R-square , F-statistic, t-statistic, p-value and AIC
Part 4: Evaluating the Model via Model Assumptions 
       -- use fitted values versus residuals plot to check linear relationship assumption
       -- use fitted values versus residuals plot to detect outliers
       -- use quantile-quantile plot to check normal distribution of errors
       -- use influence plot to detect high leverage points
       -- optimize model performance by applying these techniques above.
